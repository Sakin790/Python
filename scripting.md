# Shell Scripting in Python - Learning Path

This document provides a structured roadmap and project ideas for learning how to implement shell scripting functionality using Python.

## Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals
- Basic Python syntax (variables, control structures, functions)
- File operations (reading/writing, path handling)
- OS module basics (`os.system()`, environment variables)

### Phase 2: Shell Scripting Concepts
- Subprocess module (`subprocess.run()`, output capture)
- Implementing common shell commands in Python
- Advanced shell features (pipes, redirection, process chaining)

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- Argument parsing with `argparse`
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Robust error handling and logging

## Project Ideas

### Beginner Level
1. **File Organizer** - Sort files by extension into folders
2. **System Info Reporter** - Gather and display system information
3. **Batch File Renamer** - Rename multiple files with patterns

### Intermediate Level
4. **Log Analyzer** - Process and summarize log files
5. **Automated Backup Tool** - Create versioned backups
6. **Server Monitor** - Check system health and send alerts

### Advanced Level
7. **Custom Shell** - Build an interactive shell with custom commands
8. **Deployment Automation** - Automate software deployment
9. **Network Scanner** - Scan local network devices and services

## Learning Resources
- Python documentation (subprocess, os, argparse modules)
- "Python for Unix and Linux System Administration" book
- Online courses on shell scripting with Python
- Practice by converting existing shell scripts to Python

## How to Use This Guide
1. Start with Phase 1 concepts if you're new to Python
2. Progress through each phase, building small scripts
3. Choose projects that match your current skill level
4. Gradually increase complexity as you become comfortable
